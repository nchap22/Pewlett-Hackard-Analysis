# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:

    The purpose is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify 
    employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 
# Results:
## There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
    * There are 8 titles that are retiring, which are Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, 
    Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and manager,
    * The title that has the most people retiring are senior engineers at 25916
    * The title that has the least amount of people retiring are managers at 2
    * Also, the majority individuals who are of retiring age have senior titles such 
    as senior engineer or senior staff
# Summary:
## The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. 
    * The first question we wanted to answer was how many people are retiring per title 
    and the image below shows the exact number per title.
    * The second question we wanted answered was who is eligible to participate in the mentorship 
    program and the unique title cdv shows who is eligible and below is a snippet of a couple people who are eligible. 
   ## Queries
    * One additional query is to look at salary and this query looks at the salaries and counts the 
    number of pole with each salary:
    * However, this can be changed to run a query that has ranges, such as below 
    45,000, 45,000 to 55,000, etc. 
    * Another additional query would be able to count all those eligible to retire in all t
    he different departments instead of just looking at the different titles.
